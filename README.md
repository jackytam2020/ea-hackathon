## Description
This is a fully responsive landing page for the EA App built during our 24 hour hackathon sponsored by Electronic Arts. The purpose of this website is to educate current and new users of the new EA app to drive more downloads. Initally it was only a desktop app with data structures built within the react folder. After the hackathon, the website was made responsive and was connected to a backend using express and mongoDB to store and populate the FAQ data and carousel images.

You can view the backend codebase here:
